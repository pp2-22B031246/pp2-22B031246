##Join two tuples
#To join two or more tuples you can use the + operator:
#example  join two tuples
tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)

#Multiply tuples
#If you want to multiply the content of a tuple a given number of times, you can use the * operator:
#example 
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
mytuple = fruits * 2

print(mytuple)
